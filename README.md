# train-seat-booking-app
This project is a full-stack train seat booking system built with Next.js (Frontend), Node.js + Express (Backend), and PostgreSQL (Database).
Users can sign up, log in, and book seats based on real-time availability. The app automatically allocates adjacent seats (when possible) and prevents double booking.
The UI includes a grid layout for visual seat selection and booking status (green: available, red: booked, blue: selected). Authentication is handled with JWT.
